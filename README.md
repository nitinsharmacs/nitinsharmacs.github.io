## `bitPhile`

A knowledge repository where I add my daily notes on tech I read and blogs I create, and other content.


## Dependency

It requires [quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) to build bitPhile pages.

Once cloned this repository, you required to clone quartz as well in project root. You also need to install the node modules after clonning quartz.
